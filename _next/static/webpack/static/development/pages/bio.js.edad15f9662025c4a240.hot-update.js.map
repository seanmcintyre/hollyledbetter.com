I am fueled by the\n        thrill of growing together as a sangha of yogis, learning from\n        my students as much as they learn from me.\n      </Paragraph>\n      <Paragraph>\n        I came to New York to pursue a BFA in Dance from Tisch School\n        of the Arts where I began studying yoga under TaraMarie Perri\n        and have since completed my 300-hour teacher training through\n        the Perri Institute for Mind and Body. I had been dancing for\n        18 years when I was diagnosed with bilateral hip dysplasia and\n        was made to reassess my priorities for a body now experiencing\n        chronic pain. My yoga and meditation practices rapidly\n        deepened and I continue to be amazed at the body’s ability to\n        work with its own limitations in harmony with the mind. I look\n        forward to being curious about these realities together.\n      </Paragraph>\n      <Paragraph>\n        I am also involved with the social meditation group in the\n        Shambhala tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. This practice of\n        intentional speech and listening, holding caring space for\n        others, and focusing full-bodied attention on another person,\n        is not separate from, and has deeply informed my teaching\n        practice.\n      </Paragraph>\n      <Paragraph>\n        Other things that are a large part of my life are the ocean,\n        cycling, and peppermint tea. Originally from Seattle, WA, I\n        take the vibrant qualities of adventure and nature into\n        everything I do.\n      </Paragraph>\n      <Paragraph>Namaste.</Paragraph>\n    </div>\n  </Page>\n);\n\nconst HeadderStyled = styled.header`\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  margin-bottom: 60px;\n  max-width: 100%;\n`;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAMA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAYA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA5CA;AAiDA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
