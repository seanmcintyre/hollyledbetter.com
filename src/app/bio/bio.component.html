  <p>My classes celebrate each practitioner’s unique harmony of mind and body as well as the strong, sustainable community that is inherently created through the practice of yoga. Though my teaching practice focuses on wholeness, contentment and ease, I value inviting the your full experience into the room – life is certainly not always easeful! I am fueled by the thrill of growing together as a sangha of yogis, learning from my students as much as they learn from me.</p>
  <p>I came to New York to pursue a BFA in Dance from Tisch School of the Arts where I began studying yoga under TaraMarie Perri and have since completed my 300-hour teacher training through the Perri Institute for Mind and Body. I had been dancing for 18 years when I was diagnosed with bilateral hip dysplasia and was made to reassess my priorities for a body now experiencing chronic pain. My yoga and meditation practices rapidly deepened and I continue to be amazed at the body’s ability to work with its own limitations in harmony with the mind. I look forward to being curious about these realities together</p>
  <p>I am also involved with the social meditation group in the Shambhala tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. This practice of intentional speech and listening, holding caring space for others, and focusing full-bodied attention on another person, is not separate from, and has deeply informed my teaching practice.</p>
  <p>Other things that are a large part of my life are the ocean, cycling, and peppermint tea. Originally from Seattle, WA, I take the vibrant qualities of adventure and nature into everything I do.</p>
  <p>Namaste.</p>
